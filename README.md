# Portfolio-Landing-Page
##### {My first independent project on the go as I learn RPA}, {April 2023}
#### By **{Joseph Kihurani}**
## Description
{This is a landing page for my programming portfolio. This is my first practice at the game of creating webpages and online presence, and with increasing practice over time hope to sharpen my skills.  As a result this intial page will be quite simplistic to a webpage guru but with baby steps will eventually grow and shine pretty well with more products. }
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know? Outline any issues that would impact use of your application. Share any workarounds that are in place. }
## Technologies Used
{Tell me about the languages and tools you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}
